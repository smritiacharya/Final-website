          <p>I've always wanted to do my best in all of my subjects, but topics such as Maths and Sciences always came easy to me. Somethings I like doing in science is messing around with different chemicals and other materials and trying to see what types of reactions occur from it. Math always came easy to me, back in North Dakota we started Advnaced topics and classes at a young age.</p>
