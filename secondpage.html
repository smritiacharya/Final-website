          <h3>Places</h3>
          <p>I've traveled to many different places ever since I was very young. Being born in a small country like Nepal there is not much to do(unless you want to climb Mount Everest). So my parents decided to travel and have some fun. One of the first places I went to was Paris, France. I also went through many dfferent countries in Europe, Asia, and have been to Australia. I've traveled to all other States in the US except for Alaska.</p>

      <h3>Things I Enjoyed or Disliked</h3>
      <p>Some things that I enjoyed about trips is the fact that you get to explore a new place, meet new people and you get a sense of the different cultures and food and how life is like there. But there are also things that aren't very fun when it comes to traveling. Some of theose things include the loss of sleep and the never ending decisions on what to pack or not pack.</p>

  <h4>Who I Traveled With</h4>
  <p>I mostly traveled with my parents when I traveled around other countries or places but when going on roadtrips I traveled with any family member or really close friend and their family.</p>
